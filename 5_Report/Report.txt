             Water Level Control System


I. Summary:
      
           In this project we will be building a water level indicator using Atmega328 & ultra sonic sensor with 
two levels that consist of inside a tank with the help of 2 LEDs and a buzzer to indicate that the 
tank is full.

II. Objectives:

1. To learn the working of a water indicator 
2. Measure the water level when the circuits indicate when the tank its half and full.
3. To learn how to build simple circuits.

III. Industry-Based Applications

The water level indicator circuits are used in factories, chemical plants, and electrical 
substations and in other liquid storage systems. There are many possible uses for this simple 
system, examples include monitoring a sump pit (to control pump activation), rainfall detection, 
and leakage detection. Electronic water level circuits have the capability of alerting if there is a 
water leak somewhere in the factory. When the water level is too high or too low or exceeds the 
higher limit, it can detect the water level easily by hearing an alarm sound or from different colors 
of a light bulb. We can also measure the fuel level in motor vehicles and the liquid level containers 
which are huge in the companies.

IV. Project Methodology

The circuit is designed to indicate  levels of water stored in the tank. low but not empty, 
half and full but not overflowing. When there is no water in the tank, all the LEDs are off as an 
indication that the tank is completely empty. When water level increases and touches the sensor, 
the Red LED will glow indicating that there is water within the tank. As the water level continues 
to rise and reaches half the tank, Yellow LED will glow. When the water in the tank rises to full 
an alarm is made by the buzzer as an indication that the tank is full.
